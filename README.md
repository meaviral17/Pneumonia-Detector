# Pneumonia-Detector
This web application is based on a 2-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), trained to recognise pneumonia on chest x-rays. The neural network achieved accuracy exceeding 86% on the relevant test set of more than 500 x-rays. Please note that the predictive accuracy of the model, depends on the quality and quantity of the training data.
